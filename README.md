# AI Coding Contest Lab Repository

This repository is used for **in-lab, AI-assisted coding practice**.

## Context

The project contains lightweight bioinformatics-oriented scripts and sample inputs that are intended for hands-on experimentation during lab sessions. The focus is on practicing:

- Understanding an existing codebase quickly.
- Using AI assistance to propose, implement, and validate changes.
- Communicating changes clearly through commits and pull requests.

## Practice Tasks

Typical in-lab tasks for this repository include:

1. **Code comprehension**
   - Read existing scripts and explain what they do.
   - Identify assumptions, inputs, and outputs.

2. **Feature work**
   - Add or modify script behavior based on a prompt.
   - Improve usability (arguments, docs, edge-case handling).

3. **Quality checks**
   - Run scripts with sample data.
   - Verify outputs and document what was tested.

4. **Collaboration workflow**
   - Make focused commits with clear messages.
   - Open a pull request summarizing changes, rationale, and checks.

## Current Repository Contents

- `vcf_flank_extractor.py`: Utility script for flank extraction workflows.
- `phen2gene_predict.py`: Utility script for phenotype/gene-related processing.
- `ex2.vcf`, `HPO_sample.txt`: Example input files for practice runs.

## Notes

- This repo is primarily a **practice environment**, not a production system.
- Keep changes small and explain your reasoning to support learning outcomes.
